# From Laminas MVC to Slim: where the code lives now

odkdash is moving off laminas-mvc one controller at a time. During the move both frameworks run in the same app. This page explains the new layout for anyone who knows the Laminas one.

The short version: controllers move from `module/` to `src/`, and templates moved from `module/Application/view/` to `templates/`. Services, models and config stay where they are.

## How a request is served

Both frameworks share one front controller, `public/index.php`:

```php
$kernel = App\Http\Kernel::fromGlobals();
if ($kernel->handles()) {
    $kernel->run();       // Slim serves the request
    return;
}
Laminas\Mvc\Application::init(require_once 'config/application.config.php')->run();
```

`Kernel::handles()` asks Slim whether one of its routes matches the path. If one matches, Slim answers. Otherwise the request goes to Laminas exactly as before. No list of moved paths exists anywhere else. A route in `src/Http/Routes/` is a moved route.

Slim handlers reuse the Laminas services. `src/Services/LaminasBridge.php` loads the Laminas service manager without starting MVC, the same way `bin/console` does. `OdkFormService`, the table gateways and the translator are the same objects on both sides.

## Old and new locations

| What | Laminas location | Slim location |
|---|---|---|
| Front controller | `public/index.php` | `public/index.php` (asks Slim first) |
| Routes | `router.routes` in `module/Application/config/module.config.php` | `src/Http/Routes/Application.php`, one file per module |
| Controllers | `module/Application/src/Application/Controller/` | `src/Http/Handlers/` |
| Controller factories | anonymous classes in `Module::getControllerConfig()` | none: PHP-DI reads the constructor |
| Login and ACL check | `Module::preSetter()` | `src/Http/Middlewares/AccessMiddleware.php` |
| Error pages | Laminas view strategies | `src/Http/Middlewares/ErrorMiddleware.php` |
| `ViewModel`, `redirect()` | Laminas MVC | `src/Http/Responder.php` |
| View rendering | Laminas `PhpRenderer` | `src/View/ViewRenderer.php` and `Template.php` |
| View helpers (`url`, `translate`, …) | `view_helpers` config | `Kernel::viewHelpers()` |
| Templates | `module/Application/view/` | `templates/`, used by both frameworks |
| Services | `module/Application/src/Application/Service/` | unchanged |
| Models and table gateways | `module/Application/src/Application/Model/` | unchanged |
| Service wiring | `Module::getServiceConfig()` | unchanged |
| Console commands | `bin/console` | unchanged |

`src/` uses the `App\` namespace. `module/` keeps the `Application\` namespace.

## Routes keep the Laminas format

A route in `src/Http/Routes/Application.php` is its entry from `module.config.php` with a `handler` key added:

```php
// module.config.php
'roles' => [
    'type' => 'segment',
    'options' => [
        'route' => '/roles[/:action][/][:id]',
        'defaults' => ['controller' => 'Application\Controller\RolesController', 'action' => 'index'],
    ],
],

// src/Http/Routes/Application.php
'roles' => [
    'route' => '/roles[/:action][/][:id]',
    'handler' => RolesHandler::class,
    'defaults' => ['controller' => 'Application\Controller\RolesController', 'action' => 'index'],
],
```

The route name, the pattern and the defaults do not change:

- The name is what `$this->url('roles')` uses, on both sides.
- The pattern builds URLs exactly as Laminas built them. `Kernel::SLIM_TAILS` turns it into the Slim pattern.
- `defaults.controller` is the ACL resource, the value `Module::preSetter()` checked.

A route without a `handler` is registered for URL building only. A route with `'public' => true` needs no login.

## What a controller becomes

A Laminas controller becomes a handler with the same action methods. `SpiV3Controller::editAction()` becomes `SpiV3Handler::editAction()`. URLs do not change. `/spi-v3/approve-status` still reaches `approveStatusAction()`.

Laminas:

```php
class FacilityController extends AbstractActionController
{
    public function addAction()
    {
        $request = $this->getRequest();
        if ($request->isPost()) {
            $this->facilityService->addFacility($request->getPost());
            return $this->redirect()->toRoute('spi-facility');
        }
        return new ViewModel([
            'provinceResult' => $this->provinceService->getAllActiveProvinces(),
        ]);
    }
}
```

Slim:

```php
final class FacilityHandler extends ActionHandler
{
    public function addAction(ServerRequestInterface $request): ResponseInterface
    {
        if ($this->isPost($request)) {
            $this->facilityService->addFacility($this->post($request));
            return $this->respond->redirect('spi-facility');
        }
        return $this->respond->page('application/facility/add', [
            'provinceResult' => $this->provinceService->getAllActiveProvinces(),
        ]);
    }
}
```

The services arrive through the constructor. There is no factory to write. `ActionHandler` maps the `{action}` part of the URL to the method, as `AbstractActionController` did.

### Laminas idioms and their replacements

| Laminas | Slim handler |
|---|---|
| `$request->isPost()` | `$this->isPost($request)` |
| `$request->getPost()` | `$this->post($request)` (the same `Parameters` object) |
| `$this->params()->fromRoute('id')` | `$this->routeParam($request, 'id')` |
| `$this->params()->fromQuery('q')` | `$request->getQueryParams()['q'] ?? null` |
| `return new ViewModel([...])` | `return $this->respond->page('application/x/y', [...])` |
| `$viewModel->setTerminal(true)` | `return $this->respond->fragment('application/x/y', [...])` |
| `$this->layout()->setTemplate('layout/modal')` | `$this->respond->page('application/x/y', [...], 'layout/modal')` |
| `$this->getResponse()->setContent($json)` | `return $this->respond->html($json)` |
| `$this->redirect()->toRoute('name')` | `return $this->respond->redirect('name')` |
| `$this->redirect()->toUrl('/x')` | `return $this->respond->redirectToUrl('/x')` |
| A TCPDF template that calls `Output(..., 'I')` | `return $this->respond->output('application/x/y', [...])` |

A handler names its template in full. Laminas derived it from the controller and action names.

## Templates moved, but did not change

The `.phtml` files moved from `module/Application/view/` to `templates/` with their folders intact. Laminas finds them there through `template_map` and `template_path_stack` in `module.config.php`. Template names did not change: `'application/spi-v3/index'` is `templates/application/spi-v3/index.phtml`. The `application/` folder is the module name, as Laminas named it.

The files themselves are the same. `ViewRenderer` runs them with the same variables and the same helper names: `$this->url()`, `$this->translate()`, `$this->layout()->acl` and the others. A template does not know which framework rendered it.

Route names did not change either. A template that calls `$this->url('spi-v3-form', ...)` works on both sides. Laminas code can still build URLs for moved routes, because `src/Routing/SlimRoutesDelegator.php` adds every Slim route to the Laminas router. `redirect()->toRoute('dashboard')` in `LoginController` works even though the dashboard is on Slim.

## Access control

`AccessMiddleware` replaces `Module::preSetter()` for Slim routes. It applies the same ACL from the same tables, with three differences:

- **The ACL applies to AJAX requests too.** `preSetter()` checked only the login on AJAX requests.
- **Helper actions inherit access from their pages.** A helper is an action that a page's JavaScript calls and that has no row in the `privileges` table, such as a table feed or a dropdown fill. A role that may open a page that calls the helper may call the helper. `bin/dev/helper-access` builds the list of callers from the templates into `config/helper-access.php`. Run it after a template starts calling a new helper. `composer qc` fails when the file is out of date.
- **Every route must name an ACL resource or be marked public.** A route that does neither answers 500, so a forgotten check cannot leave a page open.

## What is still on Laminas

These controllers remain in `module/Application/src/Application/Controller/`:

- `SpiV6Controller`, the next to move.
- `LoginController`, `IndexController`, `ReceiverController` and `ReceiverSpiV6Controller`. They are public, so they move last.

When the last one moves, `public/index.php` stops falling through to Laminas, and laminas-mvc leaves `composer.json`. The services and models can then move to `src/` at their own pace.
